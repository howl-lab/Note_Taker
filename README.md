# 11 Note Taker

### The Project

To create an application based off some stater sample code that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end were provided to me as starter sample codes.

### User Story

```
AS A individual contributor
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks
```


### Application Outline

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I arrive on the landing page
THEN I am presented with a link to start on the notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing or blank notes on the left-hand column, and empty fields to enter new notes on the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and texts
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the plus icon on the top navigation
THEN I am able to enter a new note entry in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the delete button next to the notes item
THEN that item entry will be deleted from the list
```
